    <h1>Privacy Policy for StepFlow</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: February 3, 2026</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>StepFlow ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in connection with your use of the StepFlow mobile application.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p><strong>We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.</strong> StepFlow is designed with privacy as a core principle:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>All gait analysis and processing happens locally on your device</li>
        <li>Health data from Apple Watch stays on your device</li>
        <li>We never access, store, or share your health information</li>
        <li>No user accounts or login credentials are required</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>HealthKit Data</h2>
    <p>StepFlow uses Apple's HealthKit framework to access motion and fitness data from your Apple Watch and iPhone. This data includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Walking speed and cadence</li>
        <li>Step count and stride length</li>
        <li>Motion sensor data (accelerometer, gyroscope)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All HealthKit data remains on your device and is never transmitted to external servers. You can revoke HealthKit permissions at any time through your iPhone's Settings.</p>

    <h2>AI Processing</h2>
    <p>Our AI-powered gait analysis runs entirely on your device using Apple's Core ML framework. No data is sent to external servers for processing.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>StepFlow does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.</p>

    <h2>Subscription Information</h2>
    <p>Subscription purchases are processed through Apple's App Store. We do not collect or store your payment information. Apple's privacy policy governs how your purchase information is handled.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>StepFlow is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children.</p>
